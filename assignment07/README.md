Assignment 07: Bullet Physics Engine
====================================

Use Instructions
---------------------
This program does not require any command line parameters

Controls
---------------------
- WASD: Controls the movement of the puck in relation to world coordinates
- IJKL: Controls the movement of the camera in spherical coordinates in relation to the origin of the world


> Note: Most of the work on this program was done at the last minute and does not meet normal coding standards. There are many things that are hard-coded that need to be fixed. Some things have not been completely implemented or have been skipped for now. We will fix these sorts of problems for the next project submission.
