Assignment 07: Bullet Physics Engine
====================================

Use Instructions
---------------------
This program does not require any command line parameters

Controls
---------------------
- WASD: Controls the movement of the puck in relation to world coordinates
- IJKL: Controls the movement of the sphere in relation to world coordinates
- Arrow keys: Controls the movement of the camera's spherical coordinates in relation to the world's origin
- Shift + Arrow key Up/Down: Controls the zoom of the camera


> Note: Most of the work on this program was done at the last minute and does not meet normal coding standards.
> Things in the physics world have been hacked together and may not work completely correctly.
> There are many things that are hard-coded that need to be fixed.
> Some things have not been completely implemented or have been skipped for now.
> We will fix these sorts of problems for the next project submission.  
> A segmentation fault occurs when the program exits and there is also debug information about the posisition and velocity of the puck.
> Because of this, the bounding wall sometimes work and sometimes do not work, there seems to be a problem with accessing the vector memory.
