Assignment 04
=============

Assignment 4 is a model loader. No models included so you have to enter the filename at a prompt, the material file should be included in the same directory as the obj.

The arrow keys will move the model forward and back and rotate it. Shift + arrow up/down will make the model bigger or smaller.


Parses normals & uvs but doesn't do anything with them. Color handled by the fragment shader.
