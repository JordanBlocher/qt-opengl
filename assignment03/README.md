Assignment 02
=============

Assignment 2 deals with enabling callback functions for interaction with the widget. Timers will stop/start when the view is stopped/started using the context menu.

The main GLWindow uses Click-to-Focus, at which point arrow and spacebar keys are enabled.

Quit is on the main window, or use ESC.
