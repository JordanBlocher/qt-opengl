Assignment 05
=============

Assignment 5 loads models using the assimp library. No models are included so you have to enter the filename at a prompt.

The arrow keys will move the model forward and back and rotate it. Shift + arrow up/down will make the model bigger or smaller.

Color handled by the fragment shader.
