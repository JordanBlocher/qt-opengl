Assignment 05
=============

Assignment 5 loads models using the assimp library. Model files are passed to the program as command line parameters. The program does not include a workaround for it's inability to load unnamed colors in mtl files. 

The materials will default to the same directory as the model file.

The arrow keys will move the model forward and back and rotate it. Shift + arrow up/down will make the model bigger or smaller.

Color handled by the fragment shader.

There is a large devel branch with neat buffer stuff... not working..
