Assignment 03
=============

Assignment 3 includes a second cube orbiting around the first. The smaller cube has an opposite orbit, but the rotation of the smaller cube is opposite from the larger, the larger cube's rotation can be controlled with the arrow keys or reversed with the space bar/ clicking the mouse on the screen.

The display will show the direction of rotation of the large cube. A feature of the text is that it only appears when the window is in focus.
